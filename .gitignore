# We ignore everything except specific files/folders that are mandatory for
# the project. 
#
# This makes sure that user specific preferences will be discarded, whatever
# IDE, etc. is used, as well as automatically generated files such as target 
# classes, javadoc, etc. that can easily be generated locally. Also, if 
# unwanted files end up in the project root (might easily happen if a 
# developer does not use a proper path relative to the classpath or workspace
# while testing), they will also be ignored, keeping the shared project clean.
