SmartDESC Simulator Framework
=============================

This is the _Beta_ version of the SmartDESC Simulator Framework.


All You Need to Know
--------------------

You will find the most up-to-date documentation inside the repository. There is a pre-compiled _html_ version included that you can browse without downloading any tool. Things will be like this until a more definitive procedure for generating it is out, trimming down some fat in the repository. 

You need to first clone the repository on your local drive. You can do this using a terminal and enter, from any directory you like:

	git clone https://github.com/ProfFSiroisPolyMtl/smartdesc_beta.git smartdesc

Then unzip `smartdesc/documentation/html.zip`, have a look at `index.html` and start from there.


About this Repository
--------------------


### Project Organization

The whole simulator, including elements from the framework layer as well as application specific agent components, is currently a monolithic project. Future implementations will be managed using several independent modules, but this will require some refactoring and project configuration changes. For the time being, contributions need to be committed to the project as a whole.


### Contributing

The project is still unstable, evolving, and subject to significant changes. In order to keep the main GitHub shared repository clean, reliable, and free of hassle for its maintainers, writing access will remain very limited for now. 

Of course, you are free to experiment at will on your own local repository, and contributions are welcome, but they should remain "satellite". Sharing modifications between colleagues should be done via patches, Dropbox, etc. Things will remain this way until the project is more mature and strict contribution guidelines are published. Until then, please consider the main repository as read-only.
